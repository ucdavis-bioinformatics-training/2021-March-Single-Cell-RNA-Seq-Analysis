Single Cell RNA-Seq Analysis

Mar. 22, 2021 - Mar. 24, 2021, 9 a.m. - 5:00 p.m daily. **Online learning**

Contact - UC Davis Bioinformatics Core, [training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu](mailto:training.bioinformatics@ucdavis.edu)

This three-day online workshop covers experimental design, data generation, and analysis of single cell RNA sequencing data. Participants will explore a single cell experiment using the command line and R, create and modify workflows, and diagnose and treat problematic data utilizing high performance computing services. The primary packages used for analysis will be 10x software for sequence reads to counts, and the R package Seurat for downstream analysis.

A basic understanding of the command line and R is a prerequisite for success in this course. We recommend beginners enroll in our introductory courses in CLI and R. After a brief review on the first morning of the course, we will not be providing instruction in basic CLI or R.

This workshop will be held online from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm each day.

Participants will need access to a computer with a reliable connection to the internet, a current versions of [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) installed, and an application that allows them to ssh into a server (e.g. Bash for Windows, or Terminal for Apple).

If your department does not allow you to install software on your computer, please contact us ahead of time.

**Can I bring my own data?** … We will provide datasets for use during the workshop, as this helps to keep the workshop moving. There will be time, however, to discuss your own datasets and how you might work with them outside of the workshop.

**How much does it cost?** … The registration fee is $1,500 for current students, postdocs, staff and faculty at Univeristy of California campus' or UC National Labs (LBNL, LANL, LLNL), $1,750 for other academic or non-profit participants and $2,500 for other participants. We accept credit cards, as well as UC Davis recharge accounts, for payment.

**How do I apply?** … All registration is “first-come, first-served”. There is no application process.  So, sign up as soon as possible to ensure your place in the workshop.
